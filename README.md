# Titanic-EDA
A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python. Includes data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and insights to uncover patterns behind passenger survival.

#  Titanic EDA – Data-Driven Survival Insights

##  Project Overview
Uncovering the human stories behind the Titanic — through the lens of DATA ! 
I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover the factors that influenced passenger survival.  
The focus of this project is on data cleaning, feature engineering, and extracting meaningful insights using Python.

---

##  Key Features
- Cleaned missing data (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`)
- Explored survival trends based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
  - Age Groups
  - Family Size
- Created new features (`FamilySize`, `Title`, `AgeGroup`)
- Visualized data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Derived insights that can be used for machine learning models

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scipy
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Dataset:** [Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Key Insights
> Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

> 1st-class passengers had better chances of survival.

> Family size had a non-linear relationship with survival.

> Extracted titles from names provided additional value for feature engineering.

## Future Scope
> Implement machine learning models for survival prediction.

> Hyperparameter tuning and model comparison.

> Optionally deploy a web app for Titanic survival prediction.

## Personal Note
This project marks my first step in showcasing my data analysis journey on GitHub.
“Survival on the Titanic wasn’t luck — it followed patterns 
                   written by class, gender, and circumstance..” :)
